Available for download at [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deathroll-enhancer).

## Features

- **User-Friendly UI:** Initiate DeathRoll games with a simple command (/deathroll).
- **Targeted Roll Tracking:** Only rolls from the dueling player are tracked, ensuring fairness.
- **Win/Loss Tracking:** Track your DeathRoll history against other players and view your win/loss records.
- **Emote Reactions:** Enjoy emote reactions for both winning and losing.
- **Roll History:** Easily view your DeathRoll history for any player with the `/deathrollhistory` command.

## What's New

- **Win/Loss Tracking:** Your results against each player are now saved and can be viewed at any time.
- **Persistent Database:** Win/loss records and initial roll values are stored between sessions using WoW's SavedVariables system.
- **Roll Validation:** Only rolls from the specific dueling player are accepted, preventing any interference from others.
- **History Viewing:** Use `/deathrollhistory [player]` to view your win/loss record against any player. If no name is provided, it will show the history for your current target.

## How to Use

1. Type `/deathroll` to open the DeathRoll UI.
2. Input the desired roll number.
3. Target a player and initiate the roll. The target's roll result will be displayed, and you can proceed with your roll.
4. Emote reactions will automatically trigger based on the outcome.
5. To check your win/loss history against a player, type `/deathrollhistory [player]`. If no player is provided, the history for your current target will be shown.

## Emote Reactions

- **Winning:** Choose from a list of happy emotes like CHEER, LAUGH, and VICTORY.
- **Losing:** Express yourself with sad emotes such as CRY, SIGH, and SURRENDER.

## Example

After initiating a DeathRoll game with a player:
- If you win, a happy emote will be triggered (like cheering).
- If you lose, a sad emote will play (like crying).
- Your result (win/loss) will be saved in your history, and you can view it anytime with `/deathrollhistory`.
